# JavaOne

This is my very first Java project! I recently completed a showcase project for my fundamentals of programming course in college. The main goal was to demonstrate the basics of programming, more was forbidden ðŸ™„. It wasn't anything extraordinary, to be honest. I even had to use a pre-existing compiler and development environment like Replit as per the requirement for the project. 

However, now I'm determined to take this project further and delve deeper into Java. I want to explore object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java, building upon my existing knowledge of OOP, as well as advanced Java concepts, and even create my own simple compiling environment. This will be my initial foray into the language, and I'm excited to begin a genuine Java project. I plan to embark on more Java projects in the future, but let's start with this oneâ€”JavaOne!


## Compiling and Development Environment


## Java Compilation Process

### Strict OOP Methodology
Java is known for being a strict object-oriented programming (OOP) language, and this is evident in how its compiler operates. The Java compiler is quite particular about the structure of the files it accepts. It requires files to be organized in a way that includes classes, and when it compiles these files, it converts them into the ``.class`` file extension.

This strictness in adhering to OOP principles is essential in the context of Java. It ensures that the code is organized and follows the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, 
and polymorphism. Each file in Java typically holds a different class, contributing to a modular and maintainable codebase.

### Simple Compile
To compile a Java program, we use the ``javac`` command followed by the name of the Java source file. ``javac Main.java``, the command compiles the Java source code into bytecode, represented by the ``.class`` files. i.e. ``Main.class``.

After compilation, we can execute the program using the ``java`` command followed by the name of the class containing the main method. For instance, if our class with the main method is called Main, we would run ``java Main`` to execute the program.

And that's it. Can't be further complicated, but now ..

### Large Project Compile
Working on larger Java projects with multiple files, it's common to create a JAR (Java ARchive) file. Think of it as a cool bundle that holds all our compiled ``.class`` files and other essential resources together in one place. It's like packing everything up for convenience!

To create the JAR file named myproject.jar and include all the ``.class`` files in the current directory, we can run the following command: `` jar cfm myproject.jar Manifest.txt -C bin . ``

The ``jar`` command is our go-to tool for creating JAR files. The ``c`` option tells it to create a fresh new archive. The ``f`` option lets us specify the name of the JAR file we want to create. In this case, it's called ``myproject.jar``. The ``m`` option is exciting! It points to a special file called the manifest file. This file is named ``Manifest.txt`` in this command line. The ``-C`` option is like a teleporter. It takes you to the bin directory, where your compiled files reside.

By the way, let's talk about the manifest file! It's an important part of your JAR file. Think of it as an ID card that introduces your Java application. It contains vital information, like which class holds the main function, which is the entry of the program. In this case, the content of a Manifest.txt file should be: ``Main-Class: Main``. This ensures that when we run the JAR file, the correct class will be launched as the entry point of our application.

### Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
Now Let's Go a bit deeper, As has been mentioned before, in simple cases, like standalone programs, java does have a two-step compilation process to run your code. 

First, the ``javac`` command compiles your Java source code into bytecode, a low-level representation of the program. Then comes the exciting part! The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) enters the stage when you use the ``java`` command. The JVM is like a virtual computer that executes your bytecode, translating it into machine-specific instructions on the fly. This allows Java programs to be platform-independent, running on any system with a compatible JVM. 

Other programming languages, such as Kotlin, Scala, and Groovy, also rely on virtual machines for code execution. The purpose of using a virtual machine is to provide a layer of abstraction, enabling developers to write code once and run it on different platforms without worrying about low-level details. 

Interestingly, languages like C don't need a virtual machine because they are compiled directly into machine code specific to the target system, skipping the intermediate bytecode step. So, the JVM adds a dash of magic to Java by bridging the gap between your code and the underlying hardware, making Java a versatile and widely used language.

And there are actually a few reasons behind using the bytecode step, Firstly, bytecode serves as an intermediate representation of the code that is platform-independent. By compiling Java source code into bytecode, Java achieves its famous 'write once, run anywhere' capability. The bytecode is not tied to any specific hardware or operating system, making it portable across different platforms. 

Secondly, the bytecode acts as a layer of abstraction between the high-level Java code and the underlying hardware. It allows for various optimizations and enhancements to be applied during runtime by the JVM. These optimizations can improve performance, and memory management, like a built-in garbage collector, and avoid other security vulnerabilities as well. 

However, some programming languages like C can skip the intermediate bytecode step because they are compiled directly into machine code specific to the target system. This direct compilation allows C to achieve closer interaction with the underlying hardware, making it suitable for low-level programming tasks. Java's bytecode step, on the other hand, strikes a balance between platform independence and runtime optimizations, making it a popular choice for building robust and portable applications.
