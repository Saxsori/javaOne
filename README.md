# JavaOne

This is my very first Java project! I recently completed a showcase project for my fundamentals of programming course in college. The main goal was to demonstrate the basics of programming, more was forbidden ðŸ™„. It wasn't anything extraordinary, to be honest. I even had to use a pre-existing compiler and development environment like Replit as per the requirement for the project. 

However, now I'm determined to take this project further and delve deeper into Java. I want to explore object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java, building upon my existing knowledge of OOP, as well as advanced Java concepts, and even create my own simple compiling environment. This will be my initial foray into the language, and I'm excited to begin a genuine Java project. I plan to embark on more Java projects in the future, but let's start with this oneâ€”JavaOne!
